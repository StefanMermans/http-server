# http-server
Learning rust by making an http server

This project is the project from the final project in the Rust book here: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html

On top of the tasks from the book, this project adds some extra features to experience rust even more.
Because the main point of this project is to learn Rust, everything is built from scratch instead of using external crates.
